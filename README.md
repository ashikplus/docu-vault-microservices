# üì¶ Microservices-based Excel Importer System

This project is a **Spring Boot Microservices Architecture** for securely importing Excel files from AWS S3 into a MySQL database using **Spring Batch**, with full support for **JWT-based authentication**, **API Gateway**, **Service Discovery**, and more.

---

## üìö Project Overview

This system is built using the **Spring Boot Microservices pattern**, split into dedicated services to promote scalability, modularity, and ease of maintenance.

### üß© Microservices in this project:

| Service               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `auth-service`         | Handles user authentication and issues JWT tokens.                         |
| `api-gateway`          | Central entry point ‚Äî **forwards requests only**, does **not** validate JWT.|
| `file-service`         | Handles file uploads/downloads to AWS S3 or MinIO.                         |
| `metadata-service`     | Stores metadata info about uploaded files.                                 |
| `excel-import-service` | Downloads Excel from S3/MinIO and imports data into MySQL via Spring Batch.|
| `discovery-server`     | Service discovery for all microservices.                                   |

---

## üîê Authentication Flow (JWT)

- Users log in via `auth-service`, and receive a JWT.
- The `api-gateway` only forwards requests to internal services.
- Each service (`file-service`, `excel-import-service`, etc.) **independently validates** JWTs using its own `JwtAuthFilter` and `SecurityConfig`.
